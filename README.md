<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

which allows it to automatically activate and deactivate random codes at random times.
This mod is made to challenge players to play through SADX while the random codes either impedes or helps with any progress through the game.

### Built With

* [SADX Mod Loader](https://github.com/X-Hax/sadx-mod-loader)
